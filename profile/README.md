## 🧭 About Ve.ai

Ve.ai is a **research and product lab** creating ambient, memory-driven intelligence — a system that lives alongside you.  
Our work unites real-time cognition, evolving memory graphs, multi-agent reasoning, and voice-based understanding.

We believe intelligence should not live inside an app —  
**it should live with you.**

## 🧠 What We Build

### 📨 Ve Mail  
Your email, reborn as Super Intelligence.  
Understands what every message means, what needs action, and what can wait — writing and acting in your own tone and intent.

### 💻 Ve Notch  
Desktop layer that listens, observes, and acts — during meetings, creative work, or anywhere context lives.

### 🧩 Ve Mind  
Your private, encrypted memory graph.  
Captures and connects context across time — forming the foundation for a persistent digital mind.

### 🔬 Ve Labs  
Research division exploring **Ambient Graph Transformers (AGT)** and **self-regulating multi-agent cognition** — the foundation behind all Ve products.

## ⚙️ Architecture

**Ambient Graph Transformer (AGT)**  
An evolving memory architecture fusing graph reasoning with transformer learning, enabling Ve to perceive, remember, and act continuously.

**Multi-Agent Framework**  
A cognitive system made up of:
- **Sensor** — Perceives signals and context  
- **Thinker** — Plans, reasons, and learns  
- **Actor** — Executes and validates actions  
- **Interpreter** — Understands intent and routes intelligence  

**AmbieUI**  
A dynamic interface that adapts to context — bringing intelligence directly into your workspace.

- Symbolic + Latent Fusion  
- Goal-based Multi-Agent Reasoning  
- Ambient Interfaces & Cognitive UX

## 🧭 Vision

To create a **unified intelligence system** that lives with you —  
across devices, moments, and workflows.  
An AI that perceives, remembers, and acts —  
so you can think freely, create deeply, and live intelligently.
